This is a WIP web frontend wrapping the OpenAI API for an educational course setting. Users either provide their own OpenAI access key or use the server API, if an access key is provided in the environment variable and the user has sufficient permissions.

The example prompt that is currently tested in the app is adapted from (Mr. Ranedeer)[https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor].
